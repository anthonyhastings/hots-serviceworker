# Heroes of the Storm Web Application

## Introduction
This is a crude, example application which demonstrates using a ServiceWorker to cache assets so that if the user were to go offline, the page would still load and serve as if it were online. It has been built upon the [rehabstudio FE Skeleton](https://github.com/rehabstudio/fe-skeleton) so any specifics about installation or setup can be read from that repositorys documentation.
